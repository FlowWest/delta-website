## Action Items

- Contact Erin and Ben if you would like to join the ag revenue, flood risk, or communications subgroups
- Contact Mike Urkov (murkov@flowwest.com) with ideas or suggestions for presenting/visualizing results and things to include on the web portal

**In-person meeting in 2 weeks – Oct. 26 –**  **980 Ninth Street, Sacramento CA 95814, 3rd floor**

No November meeting, but Friday Nov 30 conference call in lieu of meeting

Conference calls Dec 14, Jan 11, and an in person meeting Jan 25

## September in-person meeting outcomes

- See meeting powerpoint for overview

## Data portal demonstration – Mike Urkov

- Mike showed the CVPIA website as an example of how ours could work
- [https://flowwest.github.io/cvpiaData/index.html](https://flowwest.github.io/cvpiaData/index.html)
- [https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/carrying-capacity-app/](https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/carrying-capacity-app/)
- [https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/rearing-habitat/](https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/rearing-habitat/)
- [https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/Explore-SIT-Model/](https://flowwest.shinyapps.io/Explore-SIT-Model/)
- Things to include on the web portal:
- Ben suggested adding mission statement, roles and responsibilities (this will be especially good for new members), member list/roster and agencies, calendar/schedule with conference calls and subgroup meetings
- Suggestion to include basic background information about structured decision making – what it is and how it works
- Mockup website is [deltasdm.com](../../C:%5CUsers%5CBGeske%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CMicrosoft%5CWindows%5CINetCache%5CContent.Outlook%5C7U4746GE%5Cdeltasdm.com). Contact Mike Urkov at murkov@flowwest.com with ideas and suggestions for the website.

## **CalSim updates**

## X2 scenarios

- The first runs of the X2 scenarios (presented at September in-person workshop) had some problems: setting X2 at 74 May-Aug would empty the reservoirs; this violates NMFS and FWS BiOps and therefore achieving this objective is not feasible unless we override current regulations
- Derek Hilts ran another series of X2 scenarios with new assumptions; these are somewhat feasible but in dry years they dry out Shasta (see powerpoint for results figures)

## OMR scenarios – Lauren Adams

- See powerpoint for results plots

## **Subgroup updates**

## Water availability

- X2 and OMR scenarios have been run; goal is to complete all CalSim runs by late November

## Water quality

- Working on compiling and synthesizing contaminants data from CEDEN (California Environmental Data Exchange Network)

## Chinook

- Functions have been built for movement, growth, and survival

## Delta smelt

- Planning to run 2 models (Hamilton &amp; Murphy, Rose/Smith)
- If model results disagree, will need to assess key assumptions and model inputs

## Ag revenue – Russ Freeman

- Metrics being considered include water available for irrigation, land available for agriculture (only for the Yolo notch action), and salinity (maybe)
- Russ discussed Reclamation&#39;s Statewide Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), which is used for the Coordinated Long-Term Operation of the CVP and SWP EIS
- [https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/includes/documentShow.php?Doc\_ID=23719](https://www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/includes/documentShow.php?Doc_ID=23719)
- Model has good coverage for the Central Valley
- Model uses DWR data on land use, crop types, water demand for different crops, land values, different sources of water, and cost of water supplies
- If we include the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), may need to make assumptions about groundwater availability and cost
- Ben has talked to Josue Medellin about ag revenue modeling; if we give Josue preliminary CalSim/DSM2 results, he may be able to fill in some additional gaps

## Flood Risk

- Ben has reached out to Erin Mullin at Delta Council, who has worked with the Delta Levee Investment Strategy (DLIS). DLIS has developed tools for improving levees into the future.
- DLIS prioritizes projects based on a combination of the probability of levee failure x consequences of failure
- Models are all in R code, and data/variables are in Access databases
- In next workshop, we will look at the variables DLIS uses and discuss which ones will be useful for our purposes. We can remove irrelevant ones and consider weighing some variables higher than others

## Communications and Outreach

- Brett Harvey has met with groups that do good targeted outreach
- Let Erin and Ben know if you&#39;d like to join this group
- We will include FlowWest in communications meetings, as they can help distil and visualize results
