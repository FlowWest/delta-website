## Chinook model update

- New coded wire tag report came out last week, with better estimates of escapement of hatchery origin fish for 2013
- There are significant discrepancies from the previous estimates (see graphics in meeting presentation for details)
- We&#39;re recalibrating the models to these values. Calibration should be done next week, then we can rerun the models.

## Delta smelt model update

- Rose (2013) model was originally on daily time step but since CalSim and DSM2 are monthly, we modified model to monthly time step

- Rose model used empirical food availability 1995-2006. Some of our candidate actions affect food availability so we are modeling it. Using data from Will Smith/Ken Rose and calculating monthly average food availability for 6 taxa and each life stage in a GLMM as a function of flow, temperature, secchi, and EC. We now have best fitting, taxon-specific models.
- The R code, data, and parameters for the food models are at this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bPQGpoSoBuAMmWDQZWWqP0GKEayH_cFL); feel free to play around with it and let us know if you have feedback 
- CalSim and DSM2 do not produce temperature outputs. Emanuel Rodriguez at FlowWest has modeled water temperatures in the Delta as a function of air temperatures at CDEC stations in a simple regression; this is consistent with the literature that suggests air temperature is the main driver of water temperatures. We considered adding flow as a covariate but sufficient data were not available.
- All model inputs for the delta smelt model are complete and we&#39;ve started the model calibration – calibrating to FMWT index
- Focusing on time period 1995-2006, consistent with Rose model
- Using a genetic algorithm (heuristic) – this is a simulation optimization method for estimating parameters or optimal values. This method has a tendency to find local minima/maxima, so we&#39;re running it multiple times with multiple seeds to find values the model converges on
- When calibration is completed next week, we&#39;ll start modeling the scenarios
- Before the next in-person meeting we&#39;ll convene a conference call for the Delta smelt subgroup to go over the results of both models. Tentatively planning this for Tuesday Feb. 19.

Comment from Corey: should we consider extending the model past 2006, since the system has changed over the last decade?

- Yes, this is worth considering. We&#39;ll try to pull data together for more recent years and extend the model if we can.

Comment from Scott: Differences in results between Scott&#39;s model and the Rose/Smith model might be due to the fact that Scott&#39;s model incorporates predation by silversides but the Rose/Smith model does not account for predation. Evidence suggests that silversides have a dramatic impact on eggs and larvae. In the final report, we&#39;ll just have to explain this source of discrepancies and the fact that the two models are different interpretations of system dynamics.

## New business

- Ag revenue modeling should be done by the end of next week
- Timeline: The government shutdown put us about a month behind schedule but we&#39;re hoping to summarize all model outputs by the Feb. 22 workshop. After that, we will send out the draft final report for review. We&#39;ll have either one more in-person meeting or a conference call to go over the report.
- Jim will be talking to Bruce and Josh about the plan for continuing on to Phase 2.
- Comment from Rene: It would be good to get some feedback on Phase 1 – lessons learned, things to keep in mind for Phase 2. We could potentially have a small workshop focusing on this. General agreement that this is a good i
